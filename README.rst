Simple Kernel
=============

The simple kernel is a project to learn about how kernels are developed and work. Yes, I could look at the amazing Linux kernel, but I can't understand 99% of the code right now.

The base for this kernel can be found on linuxjournal (https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/what-does-it-take-make-kernel-0)

This will not do much. Currently it powers on and prints to the screen.
