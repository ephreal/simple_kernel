Simple Kernel
=============

The simple kernel is a project to learn about how kernels are developed and work. Yes, I could look at the amazing Linux kernel, but I can't understand 99% of the code right now.

The base for this kernel can be found on linuxjournal (https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/what-does-it-take-make-kernel-0)

This will not do much. Currently it powers on and prints to the screen.

Warning... humor and satire follow.

Simple Kernel FAQ

FAQ
---

What is simple kernel?
  - Simple kernel is a lightweight kernel being developed to learn how kernels work.

How many lines of code does simple kernel have?
  - Last count showed 36. You can check the current count yourself with
    
    .. code:: sh

       cat *.c | nl

Wow.. that's really a small amount for a kernel.
  - That's not really a question.... but yes
  
Why should I use this?
  - Simple Kernel has the following amazing benefits

    - 32 bit: Widest array of cross compatibility possible with today's hardware
    - low RAM usage: Can run on any computer manufactured today and many that are older
    - Live boot only: No worries about your data being stolen
    - Fast: Loads within a few seconds of booting
    - Open source: You can review, copy, modify, fork, or do whatever else you want with the code

Sounds great, I'm sold! Er... any issues with it?
  - As cool as Simple Kernel is, it does have some known defects
  
    - Doesn't actually do anything useful
    - Only known use is to print data to the screen
    - Hardware support is somewhat lacking
    - Lack of network support
    - No utilities written for it
    - Users must perform a "hard poweroff" to halt the computer
    - Only 32 bit, can't use large amounts of memory
    - Currently under (in)active development
    - Have I mentioned the lack of hardware support yet?
    - Only been tested on virtual machines so far
    - It's only.... hey, where are you going? Come back!
